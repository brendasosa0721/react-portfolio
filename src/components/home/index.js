        <span>About Me</span>
        <br />
        <p>
          I'm a team player,do very well under pressure and love building new
          projects. I became a web developer because I was passionate about the
          tech industry and I wanted to be part of the future. I transitioned
          from the medical field and it has been the best decision. I worked in
          the medical field for over 12 years and I learned diversity,
          leadership, working as a team and creating projects that helped the
          community. I am ready to learn and eager to keep expanding my
          knowledge.
